Redirect any emails that are sent by the staging site to the administrator of the site.

== Description ==

When using the [Staging area](http://support.wpengine.com/staging/) on WP Engine, you may want to prevent the staging version of your site from sending emails to your site users. This plugin redirects all emails to the site admin.

This plugin should be activated on your Production site. Don't worry â€” it won't do anything *unless* it is active on Staging site.

This plugin is compatible with WordPress Multisite. If you're using it in a Multisite environment, it is recommended to either Network Activate the plugin, or follow the instructions for installing it to the `mu-plugins` directory.

== Installation ==

Simple installation:

1. Upload the `redirect-emails-on-staging` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress

Advanced installation (`mu-plugins` directory):

1. Upload *just* the `redirect-emails-on-staging.php` file to your `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory
2. That's it... the plugin is already activated! Take a look under Plugins > Must Use
